# [Meltano Academy](../README.md) > [Labs](./README.md) > Building Your Own Singer Tap

This lab will walk you through how to create a new custom Singer tap from scratch. To start, you'll pick an API from a sample.

## Choose an API

Pre-Filled Sample Worksheets:

- [Rick and Morty API](./resources/build_your_own_tap/TapDevWorksheet-RickAndMortyAPI.pdf)

If you'd like to pick your own API instead of the samples. we advise you complete a worksheet [here](https://forms.gle/DXsyBK72KoWjk4Qx9) before starting the lab. Filling out the worksheet will take between 5 and 15 minutes, and will help you understand the most important aspects of the API before you start writing any code. (Time to fill out the worksheet is not included in estimates for lab completion.)

## Build your tap

To build your tap, walk through the instructions in the slide deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z9O5ndQUQewC3gq8A_FP8jnfv0OSBKOpU3Fmcjrrv6c/edit?usp=sharing).
